# Vedtech
A set of tools that enable one to have CI controlled RFC/ADR documents.

From the danish word "Vedt√¶gt", which is "statute" or "bylaw", combined with "tech".


# Development
The system utilizes [task.dev](https://taskfile.dev/) for running all actions.
It should be trivial to install. Afterwards you can simply write `task help`.
